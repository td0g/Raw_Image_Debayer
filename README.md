# Raw_Image_Debayer
Script to split a raw image into its component colours

## Prerequisites

GIMP - https://www.gimp.org/downloads/
DCRaw - http://www.centrostudiprogressofotografico.it/en/dcraw/

## Instructions

Install GIMP

Download the Debayer.vbs script

Download DCRaw, place it in the same folder as the Debayer.vbs script

Drag the .CR2 raw image onto the Debayer.vbs script - This will convert the image using DCRaw and create a .bat file

When the script is completed, run the .bat file it creates - This will use GIMP to split the image into four .tiff files
